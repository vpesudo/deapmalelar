# DEAPMaLeLAr
Machine Learning algorithms for DEAP-3600 and LAr experiments

This project is intended to be the space for sharing the ML codes developed by the CIEMAT-DM group. 

In this first stage, the main lines (or subprojects) are three: 
  Position Reconstruction
  Background (neck or surface events) discrimination.
  Pulse Shape Discrimination

Please, make sure that your contributions are operative and properly documented before commiting to the repo. 
A very important piece of information is the format in which the input files are expected to be (number of columns and what each column is) so that results are replicable.
